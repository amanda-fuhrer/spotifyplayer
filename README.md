# Spotify Player
Spotify Player is a music playback application developed using ReactJS. The core focus was to explore and implement authentication mechanisms provided by the Spotify API, enabling secure access to users' personal music data. Authenticating with the Spotify API allows users to retrieve their liked songs directly within the application and aims to provide a simple yet intuitive interface for music playback. The tech stack for this project included ReactJS for frontend development, SCSS for styling and Axios for communication with the Spotify API. Throughout the development process, I prioritized understanding and implementing authentication mechanisms provided by the Spotify API, ensuring a smooth and secure user authentication flow.
